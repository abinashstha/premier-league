# premier-league

Technologies used in this project are React with Redux, Node Js to generate api.
Using the github premeire league https://github.com/openfootball/football.json, we can get score data between teams as per match for a whole season. 
Later, these data are manipulated to get matched play, win, loss, draw, goals against, goals forward,goals difference and points which we can see in this project.

Future Enhancement:
1. Use of ES6 in the backend.
2. Can show each match score, standings in different tab.
